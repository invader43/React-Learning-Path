# React-Learning-Path
This repo aims to jot down the path taken for me to learn ReactJS from scratch , meaning the assumption is that I have zero clue of how HTML , CSS , JS work .


## Methodology 
This splits my direction to several pathways 

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. React

### Getting started 
- [ ] [Learning the DOM]()
- [ ] [Understanding JavaScript DOM manipulation]()
- [ ] [Simple TODO list app]()
- [ ] [Learning CSS internal workings]()
- [ ] [Integrating the CSS into TODO list app]()


### React Journey 
Yet to understand , but Mostly I'll be learning from the Udemy Course : [The React Mega-Tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-mega-tutorial) by Miguel Grinberg.
