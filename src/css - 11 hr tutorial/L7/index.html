            I think personally that links are <a href="">cool</a>. But sometimes I <a href="">cringe them</a>.
            But sometimes I look at them as a cool way of storing important information. 
            There are cases where I have to use <a href="">hyperlinks</a> to get working.
            Theres a link I made about <a href="">gaming</a>.
            Another one about <a href="">Python</a>
            Also learnt about <a href="https://specificity.keegan.st/">Specificity Calculator</a>
